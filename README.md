# termClip
Copy and paste across terminal sessions.

### Purpose

Most command-line shell users run multiple simultaneous terminal sessions. Sometimes you need an easy way to move strings 
of text from one session to another. Client-side copy-pasting tends to be clunky, non-shell aware, and breaks the general
work flow of the command-line. 

termClip offers an easy way to copy and paste server-side directly inside the command-line. No highlighting, no mouse, no
edit menu. Clipboard lives inside the home directory and just works out of the box. Convenient idioms for common shell work
patterns are available.
